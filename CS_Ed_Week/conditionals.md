## Comparators & Conditionals

- Remember Booleans? 1/0, T/F, on/off, yes/no, etc...

- __Comparisons produce a boolean value__ by comparing two peices of data.
  - The keywords in computer languages that communicate this are called operators.
  - Sometimes, as in the case of Python, operators can look like English words.

###Python logical operators:

|Operator|Description|Example|
| :---: |---    |---    |
|and	|Returns True if __both__ sides are True|       |
|or	|Returns True if __either__ side is True|       |
|not	|Returns the opposite boolean value| not(True) is False	|


  - The comparison operators look a little more like in math, but remember they are just funtions that take two pieces of data, compare them, and return a boolean value.

###Python comparison operators:

|Operator|Name	|Example|
| :---:	|---	|---	|
|==	|Equal	|	|
|!=	|Not Equal	|	|
|>	|Greater than	|	|
|<	|Less than	|	|
|>=	|Greater than or equal to 	|	|
|<=	|Less than or equal to	|	|


- __Conditional statements use booleans to control the flow__ of the code
  - Imagine a train track switch at a fork in the tracks - insert pic of tracks

    if (lever == 1)
      //go to cincinatti
    elif (lever == 0)
      //go to new york
    else
      //lever is broken STOP THE TRAIN!!!


  - Much like these switches, 'if' statements and other conditionals are tools for controlling what path the CPU takes through the program's code. 

  - 
    if()
      ...


    if ()
      ...
    else 
      ...


    if ()
      ...
    elif ()
      ...
    elif ()
      ...
    else
      ...

    switch()
